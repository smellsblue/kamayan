# Ruby Kamayan

## Setup

Before you can start, you need to [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
You might be able to use a package manager to install it easier (such as `brew`
for MacOS or `apt-get` for Ubuntu). Next, install bundler via `gem install bundler`,
and finally run `bundle` from within this same directory.

## Running the Ruby Kamayan

Once you are set up, you just need to run the kamayan you are interested in. You
can run all via `ruby path_to_a_full_mind.rb`. You can run a whole course via
`ruby course_xx_yyy.rb`. Finally, you may run the specific serving via
`ruby course_xx_yyy/serving_xx_yyy.rb`.
