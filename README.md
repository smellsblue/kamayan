# Kamayan

A Kamayan is a Filipino communal gathering where family, friends, and close
neighbors come together, bringing what they can to enjoy a feast with one
another. The table is set with banana leaves, and all food is placed directly on
the leaves. Everyone digs in with their hands, eating their fill while enjoying
each other's company.

Welcome to the *Kamayan*, a [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) inspired feast
of knowledge, where every serving is another morsel of knowledge to improve your
understanding of Ruby (or Java, or JavaScript), programming, and related topics.

Enjoy the feast!
