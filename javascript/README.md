# JavaScript Kamayan

## Setup

Before you can start, you need to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
You might be able to use a package manager to install it easier (such as `brew`
for MacOS or `apt-get` for Ubuntu). Finally, run `npm install` from within this
same directory.

## Running the JavaScript Kamayan

Once the setup is complete, you just need to run `npm test`. This will run all
the tests, showing you which ones have failed.
